First of all we can see looped oembed background video. Source is located on YT so it works much faster.

**Section 1#**

I've coded my own template for WP. Image and text are uploaded using ACF so it is very simple to change them in WP. Animations were made with The Intersection Observer API.

** Flights map **

Using API I've created custom map that displayed pins on the map that I've added with ACF. You can simply go to the WP admin panel, select Custom Post Type "Flights" and and them to the map. It was made without plugins.
